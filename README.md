# Graduate-Admission-2
Predicting admission from important parameters. The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. I have to predict if they have a chance of admission or not. 

# Used methods
used basic Neural network model with 3 layers of 14 nodes and learned how to use validation accuracy too see if the model is overfitting or underfitting
